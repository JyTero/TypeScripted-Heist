    //Approach the mansion: Climb, lockpick, circle around
    Intro: "You see your target in the distance, a mansion built in the early 1800s. You've been stalking the house for weeks now and are fairly certain its residents are out in a marvelous party in another mansion on the other end of the city. You move towards the gates of the property, pondering your options. You could attempt to climb over the brick fence, try lockpicking the gate or circle around, looking for a hole in the fence.",
